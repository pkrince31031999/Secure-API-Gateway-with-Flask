# Secure-API-Gateway-with-Flask
Secure Microservice API Gateway using Flask Build a simple ecosystem where:  A Flask-based API Gateway handles authentication, rate-limiting, and routing to backend Flask microservices (resources).  Users authenticate via JWT and can access protected routes through the gateway only.  Optional: Add role-based access control and logging/monitoring.
